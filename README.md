🏠 3D Room Visualization with Door, Window, and Fireplace
This Python script uses Matplotlib to create a 3D visualization of a customizable room featuring a door, window, and fireplace. Users can input the room dimensions and instantly see a realistic rendering of the interior in a 3D space.

📸 Features
Fully rendered 3D room with six walls (floor, ceiling, and four walls)

Interactive Matplotlib plot with camera rotation and zoom

Customizable dimensions for:

Room length, width, and height

Door position, size

Window position, size

Fireplace position, depth, and size

Annotated room area in square meters

Color-coded elements:

Light gray walls

Saddle brown door

Sky blue window

Dark red fireplace

📦 Requirements
Python 3.6+

Matplotlib

NumPy

Install the dependencies with:

```
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
🚀 How to Run

Enter your desired room dimensions when prompted:

Length of wall 1 (X direction)

Length of wall 2 (Y direction)

Height of the ceiling (Z direction)

🛠 Customization
The following elements can be modified directly in the script:

Door settings (width, height, offset from wall)

Window settings (width, height, position from floor and side)

Fireplace settings (depth, width, height, and Y-axis offset)

These values are defined as variables near the middle of the script and can be adjusted to match specific designs or measurements.
