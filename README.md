# 🏠 3D Room Visualization with Python

This project creates a 3D representation of a room with a door, window, and fireplace using Python and Matplotlib.

It was born out of a personal motivation to overcome the fear of learning Python by building something visual, practical, and conceptually simple.

## 🚧 Possible Advancements

Here are some ideas for how this project can be improved or expanded:

### 🔄 Enhanced Customization
- Allow **user input to select which wall** (1–4) the **door**, **window**, or **fireplace** appears on.
- Support for **multiple doors or windows** with position, size, and orientation parameters.

### 🪑 Add Interior Objects
- Create **simple 3D objects** like:
  - Tables
  - Chairs
  - Sofas
  - Beds
- Use classes to define objects and **assign them coordinates within the room**.
- Support object placement logic (e.g. don't overlap walls or each other).

### 🎨 Styling & Visualization
- Add **textures or images** to walls/floor (e.g. tiles, wood, wallpaper).
- Improve lighting effects and shading.
- Enable **camera control** or interactive movement using more advanced tools (e.g. Plotly, Blender’s Python API).

### 💾 Save & Export
- Add ability to **export the room as an image or 3D file (e.g. STL or OBJ)**.
- Option to **save/load room layout** from a file (JSON or YAML).

### 🌐 Web Integration
- Convert the tool into a **web app** using Flask or Streamlit for real-time input and rendering.
- Allow people to customize and visualize rooms directly in the browser.
